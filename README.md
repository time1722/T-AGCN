# About
This is the PyTorch implementation of Transformer-Enhanced Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (T-AGCN) from the paper "Transformer-Enhanced Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Flow Prediction". It is designed to model spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic flow data for accurate traffic forecasting.

# How to run
You can run main.py to train T-AGCN. (Some datasets require appropriate preprocessing for special values)
